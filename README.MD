## Stealth Ward
![Demo Image](https://i.imgur.com/aNgwIaK.png)

Stealth Ward is a simple application that allows you to listen to the live updates of the LCU (League Client Update, aka the 'new' client). Everytime an endpoint is updated, it is notified in the app, and you can filter which category of endpoints you want to listen to.
Education purpose only.
